# This is a beta version of the game and not the full version, as there are more improvements to be made to make this project a masterpiece. One future improvement is to add more scenarios to each option so the user will have more time to think each option through. Another future development is adding animals to this game to have a little friend with the user to add more storylines to it as well.
